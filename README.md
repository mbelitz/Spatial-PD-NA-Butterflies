# Spatial-PD-NA-Butterflies
Code for Earl et al. "Spatial phylogenetics of butterflies in relation to environmental drivers and angiosperm diversity across North America"


## In the data repository, there are four subdirectories:
1) Angiosperms - Biodiverse outputs for the angiosperm plant data adpated from Mishler et al. 2020
2) Biodiverse_Inputs - geographic data used for Biodiverse analyses to generate phylodiversity metrics for the butterflies of North America
3) Biodiverse_Outputs - Biodiverse outputs for the butterflies of North America
4) Model_Covariates - Environmental layers used to predict butterfly phylodiversity metrics 

## In the figure_outputs directory, there are the raw .png's of the Figures
1) Figure 1
2) Figure 2
3) Figure 3
4) Figure 4
5) Figure 5

## In the scripts directory, there are two subdirectories:
1) Figures - code to reproduce the 5 main text figures
    --- note that correlations referred to in the main text are calculated in Figure 4 ---
2) Models - code to reproduce the models presented in the paper
